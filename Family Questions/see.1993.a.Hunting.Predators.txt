None of you seemed to understand when I said (wrote) that I hunt human predators - rapists, murderers, pedophiles and child abusers - for my employers - I meant it in the simplest way possible.

My employers hire bad people sometimes - I get told who - I find out who they've hurt and how - my employers get rid of them.

It's boring, tedious, paperwork - most times people threaten me - if you've read about my brain damage - you know how well that goes for them.

Sometimes people try to kill me - if you've read about my brain damage - you know how well that goes for them.

If you still want more details - I'll put stuff in the 1993 folder - when I started hunting predators for the NS gov't at the NSAC.
