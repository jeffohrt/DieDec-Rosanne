From April 22nd 2017 to April 22nd 2019 I was held against my will in Beach Meadows Nova Scotia, in the home of a raping, murdering pedophile from my childhood, by a single threat - Larry Williams would be killed the way he almost died in 2016 if I left, told anyone or refused to care for him.

From 2017 - 2019 I was forced into the homes and chores of the other 2 raping, murdering pedophiles from my childhood.  I was forced by a single threat - Larry Williams would be killed the way he almost died in 2016 if I didn't go.

The same 3 women that beat me into brain damage before I was 10.  The same 3 women that starved, mutilated and beat me into one of the worst fatal sexual assaults / mutiliations in modern Canadian times (more severe than David Reimer).  The same 3 women that threatened to give my younger brother and sister to the same child rapists I was given to if I went to teachers, doctors, lawyers, the courts or the RCMP from 1980 to 1994.

The same 3 women that did much, much more.

This is that threat, explained.

My Grandfather was Erlin Conrad.  His wife was Wilhelmina (sp?).  His children are my mother Karen, my aunt Rosanne and my Uncle Dennis (Bub).

Larry Williams is Rosanne's husband.  He has Huntington's as does his sister Cathy.  His sister Dale does not.  His brother Marvin is under debate.

I don't know when Larry retired from the mill.  His Huntington's was showing towards the end of his time at the mill.

Several of the men from the mill spoke to me in 2017, telling me they had covered for Larry in his last few years at the mill so he could get his pension.

From the time Larry retired until he surrendered his license (at the suggestion of Dr. McKelvey - the Halifax Huntington's specialist) in October 2016 - Larry drove to town 4-5 times a day for meals, coffees and night drives before bed.  Rosanne had abandoned him - as she had abandoned her family so many times in the past.



In 2015, I looked after Erlin for 8-12 hrs a day, 7 days a week, for 4 months.  Dennis and I cooked every day for Erlin's medical needs.  I wrote a cookbook about it.

I saw Rosanne once.  Her father was dying, I didn't know Erlin had ordered a stop to his medical treatments - but Rosanne did.

Rosanne abandoned him the way she had abandoned her family so many times before.  Rosanne was a disembodied voice on the phone for 4 months - shrieking from the cottage (45 min away) that it was Jeffrey's turn (to look after Erlin).  Wilhelmina shriked back, from Erlin's kitchen, that Rosanne had abandoned her parents like she did in the 1980s.  Wilhelmina shrieked that Larry was still driving to town 4-5 times a day.  Shrieking that Larry was a danger to everyone and the RCMP would come looking for her (Rosanne) again.  And much more.

Rosanne explained (in 2017-19) that the RCMP had been sent to her home so many times that she had to get special letters explaining Larry's medical issues.  Rosanne (in 2017-19) bragged how often and how easily she could get the RCMP to go away.

In 2017, as rumors spread that Rosanne had abandoned him (Larry) again.  As rumors spread several members of the community came to me, to confess they had reported Larry for his driving as much as for the community's concern Rosanne was neglecting him.

She came to supper one time in 4 months and it ended in a screaming / slamming dishes on the counter match with Dennis so violent I got up from the supper table and stood infront of Erlin to finish my meal so he wouldn't be hit by glass if any of the casserole dishes Rosanne was trying break - broke.
