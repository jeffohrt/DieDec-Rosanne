I don't know when Larry Williams retired from the mill.  His Huntington's was showing towards the end of his time at the mill.

Several of the men from the mill spoke to me in 2017, telling me they had covered for Larry in his last few years at the mill so he could get his pension.

From the time Larry retired until he surrendered his license in October 2016 - Larry drove to town 4-5 times a day for meals, coffees and night drives before bed.

In 2015, I looked after Erlin Conrad (my 93 year old grandfather) for 8-12 hrs a day, 7 days a week, for 4 months.  Dennis Conrad (my uncle - he and Erlin raised me) and I cooked every day for Erlin's medical needs.  I wrote a cookbook about it.

I saw Rosanne (maternal aunt - Larry's wife - Erlin's daughter, Dennis' sister) once.  She came to supper one time in 4 months and it ended in a screaming / slamming dishes on the counter match with Dennis so violent I got up from the supper table and stood infront of Erlin to finish my meal so he wouldn't be hit by glass if any of the casserole dishes Rosanne was trying break - broke.

Rosanne was a disembodied voice on the phone for 4 months - shrieking from the cottage (45 min away) that it was Jeffrey's turn (to look after Erlin).
