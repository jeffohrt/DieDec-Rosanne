This document is slightly different - no preamble - no reminders of who is who.

If you’ve read 1991 Walter and Lois - you know what’s in it.

If you’ve read 1992 Morash and Grantmyre - you know I was correctly diagnosed with a short, ugly, violent life.  I was wrongly diagnosed - leading to a second decade like David Reimer - which only made my life shorter, uglier and more violent.

If you’ve read 1992 Morash and Grantmyre - you know Karen lied about all this in court.

If you are wondering why I didn’t say anything :

A) Suzanne and John Paul still lived with Karen - and Karen, Wilhelmina and Rosanne were still threatening to do everything to them - that was done to me - except that now covers rape and murder and Karen knew it.

B) A lot of bad shit happened at the NSAC in 1992 and 1993.

The one thing that most people will understand - or at least can imagine - I was restrained and penetratively raped by 15 men and women at the Nova Scotia Agricultural College in the first week of September 1992 - as part of a frosh hazing ritual that went sideways when my sexual mutilations were discovered.

I lived with these people for 5 years.  I went to classes with them.  I worked with them.  I ate with them.

But I now had a word for my childhood.

In 1992 … a 15 person gang rape was the 3rd worst event of my life.
In 1992 … penetrative child rapists from 1980 to 1985 were the 2nd worst event of my life - this was worse than gang rape.
In 1992 … 12 years of Karen, Wilhelmina and Rosanne threatening the rape, mutilation and murder of my siblings tied with child rape as the 2nd worst event of my life.
In 1992 … 6 years of sexual mutilations, producing brain damage and injuries more severe than David Reimer - was the worst event of my life - worse than gang rape - worse than child rape

The beatings and brain damage from before age 10 - not even in the running.

The beatings at Saint Anne’s - that upset an entire teaching staff - not even in the running.
