In 1997 I finished college at the NSAC (Dalhousie).

I was still banned from Beach Meadows and for asking for help - but my brother (youngest) had moved away years ago.

I packed my possessions in 6 x 120 L tupper ware totes.  They were clean, dry and had both moth balls and silica desiccating bags for RV storage in each one.  Each one was duct taped shut to prevent rodents and moisture from getting in.

I rented a truck and drove them to Beach Meadows.  I asked Dennis and was given permission to store them in the old house.  I put them in the main bedroom upstairs.

I returned to Truro, returned the truck and flew out west for work for what I anticipated and told Dennis would be 5-10 years.
