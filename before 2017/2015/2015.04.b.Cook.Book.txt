In 2015 - from April to August - I spent my days with the 2 men that raised me.  Rosanne was never around - appearing only once, one supper, in 4 months.  Karen was around a little more - but not much.  Wilhelmina was my only toll to be paid.

Erlin's diet was abysmal.  I frequently asked if he could have this or that - he'd tell me to taste it - if it was any good - he wasn't allowed.

Erlin had 1/3 of 1 kidney left.  Not 1 1/3 ... just 1/3

It was a miracle he wasn't on dialysis.

Dennis cooked the main meals - main dishes - I handled side dishes and baking.

I revamped all the recipes I could find - cooking with Dennis every day - with 0 absolutely 0 sodium ingredients.

I re-created as many of Erlin's favorite dishes as I could.

I wrote a cookbook about it.
