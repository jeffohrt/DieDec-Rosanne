No one in  my family is aware I was held illegally in China for 2 months in 2014/15.  I was threatened daily with Chinese prison if I didn't sign false work and visa documents.

The Canadian Shanghai Embassy was beyond useless - telling me to cooperate with child abusers or go to prison.

The British and American Embassies were more supportive and helpful.

I got out of that on my own - not the first time I've been held illegally in a country while someone scrambles to cover up what I was employed to do - and found.

In the last days of Jan 2015 - I flew to Halifax in the worst storm in Halifax's history.

I rented an apartment on South and South Park.  I lived at a coffee shop called 'Humani-Tea' and the Halifax Library (also had an excellent coffee shop).

I let Danielle know I was in the city - and not going to Beach Meadows.

In March Danielle let me know that it would be Erlin's last summer.  I didn't learn until 2018 that Erlin had ordered a stop to all his medications and medical treatments - he picked his last summer.

In the last days of March 2015 - I went to Beach Meadows to ask Dennis for my childhood home - so I could be close to help with Grandpa.
