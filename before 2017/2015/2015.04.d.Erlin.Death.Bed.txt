The first time Erlin broke down - I didn't know what he knew - it made sense very quickly ...

Erlin's Death Bed confessions occurred more than a dozen times that summer.  It took extreme stress, flashbacks of my childhood (I would learn), to trigger a breakdown where he told me everything and within a day and better health - he forgot he had told me.  It was a fresh new wound every time for him.

Erlin would have to be alone, just after Wilhelmina had screamed she wished I was never born.  It happened more often after he was abused by Wilhelmina - Karen or Rosanne.  It happened more often after a trigger involving food - especially me bring him food.  He was living my childhood - in reverse - he was the sick one, the one being beaten and starved ...  I was the one bringing him food - cooking for him - the way he snuck me food and clothes as a kid.

Erlin always started with - you're not like the other grandchildren.  I hope they're not like you.

Erlin : Do you remember waking up on the floor ? Do you remember being different after being beaten that week ?

Erline didn't have the word brain damage - but he knew I was different - not the same as the other grandchildren - and he knew it was because of one, week long, beating.  A beating I got because he had given Suzanne and John Paul to Rosanne.

Erlin explained, with his grade 6 vocabulary, that he knew his wife and daughters were psychopaths - and Dennis wasn't.  He knew they hurt people to get what they wanted.  He knew they hurt people to make other people do things.  He knew that unless they were 100% the only winner - they'd just keep hurting people.

Erlin explained he remembered me differently before the beating - when I was normal - like my siblings - like when we all got beat over the clothesline.

Erlin explained he had tried to do his best - giving each woman a little of what they wanted - but that only made them angrier.

Erlin explained that Karen beat the 4 of us so badly, so many times, he was worried she'd cripple or kill the youngest 2 - so he gave them to Rosanne.

Erlin explained that it only made it worse - that when I told the teachers at District 7 about it - I took the beating he feared would kill his grandchildren.

I never explained Karen's lies about that day - they didn't matter.

Erlin explained that he knew I was broken - that Karen and Rosanne and Wilhelmina knew they had broken me (brain damage).

Erlin explained that that is why they argued so much and so often about how to beat me afterwards.

Erlin explained he couldn't send his wife and daugters to jail.  He explained he did his best to help me - and that it only made it worse.




Erlin explained that when Cody was born, when Karen and Rosanne and Wilhelmina were at a stalemate about giving Suzanne to Rosanne - that Erlin stepped in.  Erlin had caught the men abusing me (he could never say rape - and he was wrong anyway) and made a deal with Karen, Rosanne and Wilhelmina - Suzanne would be sent to Rosanne's to help with Cody - and I would be left alone.  No more men visiting me in the backyard.

The problem with that - the thing I never explained to Erlin - I stopped the rape a year before Cody was born - I cut a man to the bone in the backyard and openly wore a knife after that.  No one had touched me in a year.  Suzanne was given to Rosanne - for no reason at all.
