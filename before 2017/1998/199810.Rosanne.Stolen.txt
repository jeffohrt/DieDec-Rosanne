In 1998 I drove a motorcycle from Alaska to PEI.  In October I turned around and drove back.  I made it to Winnipeg when snow storms grounded me.  I left the motorcycle with my Uncle Paul and Aunt Becky.  I drove back in Feb 1999 to grab the motorcycle as Paul and Becky were being deployed overseas.

In October 1998 I stopped in Beach Meadows only long enough to see Erlin and Dennis.  I wasn't staying with anyone.  I was camping in the woods as I had all across Canada.

Dennis pulled me aside and said I had to go clean up the mess I had made at the old house.

I went and found everything I owned from college in a giant pile of rot, mold, mildew and mouse droppings.  The mice had eaten and ruined almost everything.  I salvaged 2 small boxes of books and pictures.

When I asked Dennis what had happened, that I had stored everything in 120 L rubber totes that were taped shut, the year before.  When I reminded Dennis that he had seen them on the back of the truck the year before.

Dennis said only he had gone to the old house after I left - and found the mess the way it is today.

When I spoke to Karen - I was told that Wilhelmina had sent Rosanne to the old house the second I was gone in 1997 and Rosanne had stolen all the rubber totes to use at school.

Rosanne still had some of them in 2017.  She stored snowmobile clothes, spare hats and mits for her students in them.
