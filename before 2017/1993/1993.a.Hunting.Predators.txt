This document is slightly different - no preamble - no reminders of who is who.  This document is for my siblings and cousins.

If you’ve read 1991 and 1992 .. then you can understand this :

In 1992 … a 15 person gang rape was the 3rd worst event of my life.
In 1992 … penetrative child rapists from 1980 to 1985 were the 2nd worst event of my life - this was worse than gang rape.
In 1992 … 12 years of Karen, Wilhelmina and Rosanne threatening the rape, mutilation and murder of my siblings tied with child rape as the 2nd worst event of my life.
In 1992 … 6 years of sexual mutilations, producing brain damage and injuries more severe than David Reimer - was the worst event of my life - worse than gang rape - worse than child rape

The beatings and brain damage from before age 10 - not even in the running.

The beatings at Saint Anne’s - that upset an entire teaching staff - not even in the running.

In 1993 I started a job as a form of security - a Residential Assistant - a glorified babysitter - at the Nova Scotia Agricultural College - the Ag Department for Dalhousie.

It went bad, fast.  This is how I started hunting physical and sexual predators for my employers.  In 1993 - that was the Nova Scotia Government.
