1994 was my first year tree planting.  I did well but got back late - barely in time for work and school.

Karen began borrowing money from me - begging and pleading - promising she'd pay it back or do anything to help me in the end (my own death).

I lent her the money - naively believing if I could break her cycle - I could help my sisters avoid being the 4th generation of psychopaths.

I lent her money with a condition - John Paul was to come visit me at college - but he wasn't to be told I had to pay Karen to allow it.
