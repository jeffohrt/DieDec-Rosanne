In 2014 I was living in Saigon, Vietnam.

I was in a teacher licensing program, naively trying to find a way to come home for a woman.

I was in a teacher licensing program, naively trying to get away from hunting predators.

Part of that licensing program required I interview teachers and parents with specific educational contexts or challenges.

I worked in a school with 5 campuses and 5000 students.

When it came to students with special needs - I called to interview my sister about her child - as much because I wanted to try to teach in Canada - as my sister would be easier to talk to.

When she reminded me that Rosanne was a special needs specialist - and that she'd given up a VP position to take a 2nd grade classroom position - it set off the same red flags I was trying to avoid.

I called Rosanne and on the pre-text of the same interview worked Rosanne around to discussing the jump from administration to (back) the classroom.

Rosanne initially claimed she didn't want to work under the Principal she'd be assigned to.

With a little more prodding - Rosanne admitted that she had been pushed out (of admin positions) by staff that were not only unhappy with her - but by staff that had filed complaints about her mental health, stability and use of threats.

This was what I was worried about - Wilhelmina, Karen and Rosanne - 3 for 3 on mental breakdowns that cost them the ability to work in their 50s.

From 2017 to 2019 - Rosanne screamed that she would never go to prison.  That they (the staff in 2014) had tried to get rid of her then (2014) and she still had her job.
