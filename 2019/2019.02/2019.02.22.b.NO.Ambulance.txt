February 22nd 2019, I brought Larry home to call an ambulance.

Larry was in the porch, trying to get undressed (from his outdoors clothes).

As I picked up the phone, I didn't hear the back door open.

Before I could press a button, Rosanne snatched the phone out of my hand, slammed it down and began screaming :

"Why does your grandmother say you refused to look after Larry at the supper table ?"
"Why does your fucking grandmother say you took Larry to the fucking hospital ?"

My answer - I explained supper, Larry unable to stand or swallow, I took Larry to the hospital to see Tammy and how busy it was.

I told Rosanne - 3 dozen people - I asked 3 dozen people at 5:30, if they knew Tammy ?  Some did - they'll remember me.

I told Rosanne - a dozen doctors and nurses - I described Larry and his weeks of medical crisis to a dozen doctors and nurses - they told me to go home and call an ambulance.  So I tried.

Rosanne grabbed Larry and screamed at me - "I'll deal with you when I get back."

Rosanne spent 7+ hrs at the ER - and told a very different set of lies.  Then to drive home that Rosanne can lie to anyone about anything and I'll never be believed ...

Rosanne wrote Danielle telling her that Larry had had a close call - but luckily Rosanne recognized it from 2016 and took him to the hospital right away.

The Facebook Message is in the repo.

Investigators should find that JP - to see I gave a very different accounting on the 19th.
