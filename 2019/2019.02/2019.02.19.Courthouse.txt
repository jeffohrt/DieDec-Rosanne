The 3rd week of February was even worse.

Larry was so close to death that on February 19th, 2019, under the pretext of taking Karen to an appointment in Bridgewater - I went to the Bridgewater Courthouse.

I was interviewed by a Justice of the Peace for 2 hrs - I was almost an hr late picking Karen up.

The JP took many pages of notes as I explained, briefly, Larry's situation and his need to go to the hospital.

The JP helped me prepare the Restraining Order paperwork as well as the Emergency Protection Order paperwork - so that when I took Larry to the hospital - if Rosanne interfered - it would be one phonecall to have guardianship of Larry transfered to me, and Rosanne removed and barred from the home and hospital - until Dustin or Cody could return to Canada.
