Feb 22nd 2019 : Rosanne grabbed Larry and screamed at me - "I'll deal with you when I get back."

Rosanne spent 7+ hrs at the ER - and told a very different set of lies.  Then to drive home that Rosanne can lie to anyone about anything and I'll never be believed ...

Rosanne wrote Danielle telling her that Larry had had a close call - but luckily Rosanne recognized it from 2016 and took him to the hospital right away.

Investigators should find that JP - to see I gave a very different accounting on the 19th.
