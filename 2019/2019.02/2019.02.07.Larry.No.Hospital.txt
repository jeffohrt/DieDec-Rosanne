Everything from the first week of February - got turned up a notch for the second week of February.

On Feb 11th - Larry didn't sleep - his medical crisis had grown to the point his anti-psychotics wouldn't put him in a deep enough sleep and he was up all night - wandering the house - looking for a drink and going to the bathroom.

Every night - Rosanne screaming the same insanity about Larry faking, and her doing everything, and it's our turn to watch Larry die, except now ...

Karen and Wilhelmina are discussing - purely to enrage Rosanne - that yes - when Larry had the heart attack in 2016 - it was all just like this - it started on Karen's birthday (Nov 13th) and Larry was in a coma by the 16th.

Rosanne continued screaming and beating me and screaming - It's your turn to watch him die - He's faking - Don't you fucking dare take him to the hospital - I'm the wife, I'm the medical proxy - Larry already signed the papers ...

Each night as Rosanne screamed at me, free of having to watch her language because it was just her and I - Rosanne screamed the same rational ... she doesn't care if Larry dies - he's already signed the papers giving his pension to her when he's dead.

Rosanne screaming every night that when Larry dies - she's blaming me - because everyone knows I look after Larry ...

Every night - on top of the 7 murders and rape, the mutilations and torture - the starvation.

Rosanne screaming at me every night - she'll kill Larry outright - she won't wait - if I take him to the hospital - she'll make sure he never comes out.  She'll kill him in the house herself if she has to.
