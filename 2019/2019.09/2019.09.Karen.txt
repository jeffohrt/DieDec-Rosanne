In September or October of 2019 Danielle was coming to my apartment to see me and drop off some mail.

Karen, at the last second, hopped into the car and demanded to come with.

Danielle didn't know what to do - so she brought Karen to my apartment.

I thanked Danielle for the mail  - and told her bluntly, to tell Karen, in front of Rosanne - if I ever see them again - they all go to prison.
