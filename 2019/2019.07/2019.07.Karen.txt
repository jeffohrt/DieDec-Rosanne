Karen cornered me in the parkling lot of the drugstore in July 2019.

She was sobbing and crying and begging to know why I didn't talk to her.  Why I didn't come visit her anymore ?

I told her simply :

Ask Rosanne.
Ask Danielle.

If I ever see you again - you, Rosanne and Wilhelmina go to prison.
