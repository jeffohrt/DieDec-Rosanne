March 29th - Friday - a week to the day

Rosanne does not appear at her house.  Housekeeping and keepers goes as per normal - except all they want to do is understand why Karen keeps winding Izzy back up.

Rosanne orders Karen and I to Izzy's again.  Same old same old.  Same ritual drive - screaming matches - you're getting what you deserve, I don't care if  you die, I don't care if you kill yourself, I don't care if Rosanne kills you.

In Izzy's house - everything is different - sort of.
