Dennis never questioned why I took 3 potatoes, awkwardly, with my left hand and tucked them inside my jacket.

I thanked him and left.



3 potatoes - 30 seconds - 1 dislocated shoulder.


Rosanne was gone - not in the bathroom, den or porch - she didn't leave the house as I never heard the door - that left 1 place - the laundry room - where Rosanne steals Dennis' black rum - her drinking and drug addictions was not something I wanted to deal with, with 1 arm, so I left.

Resetting my shoulder makes me even more vulnerable for a day or 2 - so I washed the potates, grated them and made Larry's lunch.  I didn't eat any on principal.

I expected Rosanne to come at 3 to poison Larry - she didn't

I expected Rosanne to come and finish the beating - disrupting her pathological rituals only leads to even greater violence. - she didn't show up.

I finished Larry's lunch dishes - had my hot shower and put my shoulder back in.

That night at supper - Rosanne was in a spectacular mental breakdown.  Wilhelmina carved slices off her daughter's soul with : "Larry - what did you have for lunch ?"

Wilhelmina was so excited to drive that particular dagger into Rosanne - she couldn't even wait for Tammy to ask - as she did every day - as Tammy and Larry set the table.

Larry : "Pancakes"

Confused looks to me : "Okonomiyaki - Japanese potato pancakes.  I lived there for a year."

The 19th was a Tuesday - Rosanne's breakdown lasted until Friday morning.

Wednesday and Thursday - no beatings, no rituals - just Rosanne sobbing in her father's chair while everyone ate in silence except Karen and Wilhelmina - they raked Rosanne over the coals every second they got.

Friday morning - March 22nd - Rosanne came to get even - and ended up assaulting both her husband and her housekeepers - in front of each other.
