This document is slightly different - no preamble - no reminders of who is who.  This document is for my siblings and cousins.

Family : Are you telling me - Larry ate food bank donations for 10 months - while Rosanne collected 100k in salary and pensions.  He ate out of the food bank the entire time Dustin and Sarah visited in Sept and Oct 2018.

Jeff : Yes.  They also ate food bank donations.  Rosanne stole them the last week of August.

Family : Are you telling me - Larry ate food bank donations the entire time Rosanne renovated and remodeled the cottage with Larry’s pensions.

Jeff : Yes.

Family : How’d you get to the food bank during Dustin’s visit - he had Larry’s truck the entire time.

Jeff : Dennis lent me his truck to drive Larry.  I borrowed it to go to town on Tuesdays for “groceries”.  I never told Dennis where the groceries came from.
