From April 22nd 2017 to April 22nd 2019 I was held against my will in Beach Meadows Nova Scotia, in the home of a raping, murdering pedophile from my childhood, by a single threat - Larry Williams would be killed the way he almost died in 2016 if I left, told anyone or refused to care for him.

From 2017 - 2019 I was forced into the homes and chores of the other 2 raping, murdering pedophiles from my childhood.  I was forced by a single threat - Larry Williams would be killed the way he almost died in 2016 if I didn't go.

The same 3 women that beat me into brain damage before I was 10.  The same 3 women that starved, mutilated and beat me into one of the worst fatal sexual assaults / mutilations in modern Canadian times (more severe than David Reimer).

Larry Williams is Rosanne's husband.  He has Huntington's.

Tammy (Hatt / Kennedy) is my Uncle Dennis' girlfriend - my defacto aunt - I'd known her since I was little.

In mid May of 2018 Rosanne fled to the cottage.  She hadn't kept food in her Beach Meadows house since March.  Hadn't slept 2 nights in a row or 4 in week in her Beach Meadows home since April.  In mid May she left and didn't come back until the first of July.  She lived at the cottage, 45 min away and still came to Beach Meadows to beat Larry, Dennis and I 2 or 3 times a week - it was on her way from work to the cottage.

In July, the day after my sister flew back to Europe (
