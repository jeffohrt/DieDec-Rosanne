Rosanne destroyed my deceased son's funeral gifts the day after Christmas - because I made Larry food on Christmas day.

I went to Social Services in Liverpool, I requested a case worker, I explained, briefly, my terminal medical issues, my captivity and the threats against my family.

I asked for and was given a place in a men's shelter in Halifax (closest men's shelter).

Social Services made arrangements for to be taken to Halifax with just a phone call.

I asked for time to try to figure out how to tell Dennis I was leaving - and likely sending his entire family to prison.
